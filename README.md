# DETECTION OF FAKE NEWS


## The Problem
Majority of news consumers see fake news as a major problem in the present generation. A fake news are a kind of news story that are false: the story is itself fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes.
Fake news can originate from any number of sources and is shared across different platforms. One of the hallmarks of fake news is that the current looks as though it's produced by reliable news outlets. Other forms of misinformation - such as deepfakes, biased reporting, and selectively quoting sources-add to the confusion, making it increasingly difficult for new consumers to identify what is true.
Fake news although is not a big threat and exist across variety of media-like TV, radio and online media-much of recent discourse around fake news involves social media platforms. Fake news are often spread through social media sites, despite efforts by many companies to identify and remove them.
The problem is very challenging because the bots getting better are tricking us. it is not so easy to detect wether the information is true or fake all the time, that is why better systems are required that can help us understand the patterns of fake news.
